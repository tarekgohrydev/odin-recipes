    <img src="../images/Noodle.png" alt="">
    <p>There's just something delightfully addictive about this special combination of cold and spicy.<br>This recipe is
        the perfect catchall for all those summer vegetables we're supposed to be eating more of, as well as any dry
        leftover chicken you have around</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 cup grated carrots</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <br>

        <br>
        <li>Transfer spaghetti to a mixing bowl; add the chicken, carrots, bell pepper,<br>and green onions. Pour in the
